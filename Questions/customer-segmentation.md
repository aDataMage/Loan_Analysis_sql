- What demographic combinations (age, education, marital status) represent ideal customers?
- How do default rates differ between employment types and which segments should be prioritized?
- Which customer profiles consistently request appropriate loan amounts relative to income?
- What's the lifetime value profile of customers with different credit history lengths?
- Which customer segments show the most improvement in risk metrics over time?
